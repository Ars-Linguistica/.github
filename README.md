# ARS Linguistica - Where Linguistics Meets Open Science


Welcome to ARS Linguistica, a Github organization devoted to advancing the field of linguistics through the development of free and open source tools and resources. 💡

We believe that open source and open science are key to making the study of language accessible to everyone, regardless of their background, resources, or location. Our goal is to create a community of individuals who share this belief and are passionate about using technology to explore the diversity and complexity of human language. 🌎

At ARS Linguistica, we are committed to creating high-quality linguistic resources and tools that can be used for teaching, research, and documenting under-resourced languages. We believe that open source resources are especially important for preserving and revitalizing endangered languages, which are a critical part of our cultural heritage. 🧬

If you are interested in linguistics, open source software, or the intersection of technology and language, then ARS Linguistica is the place for you! Join us in our mission to make the study of language more accessible, inclusive, and impactful. 🚀


## Our Mission 💪

ARS Linguistica is dedicated to advancing the field of linguistics through the development of free and open source tools and resources. Our mission is three-fold:

1. To provide access to quality linguistics tools for all:
   We believe that everyone should have access to quality linguistic tools, regardless of their background or financial situation. Our goal is to develop free and open source tools that are accessible to everyone and can be used for a variety of purposes, including research, teaching, and documenting under-resourced languages. 🧰

2. To build a comprehensive collection of open source grammars:
   Linguistics is a vast field, and there is a need for a comprehensive collection of grammars for different languages. Our goal is to collect and create open source grammars for as many languages as possible, so that everyone can benefit from them. Whether you're a student, researcher, or language enthusiast, our grammars will provide you with the resources you need to learn, research, and understand the structure and function of different languages. 📖🌍

3. To foster a community of open source and open science enthusiasts:
   We believe that open source and open science are the future of linguistics. By fostering a community of individuals who share this belief, we hope to create a space where people can collaborate, learn, and grow together. Our goal is to bring together individuals from different backgrounds and perspectives to work towards a common goal: advancing the field of linguistics through open source and open science. :two_women_holding_hands:

In short, our mission is to provide quality linguistics tools and resources, build a comprehensive collection of open source grammars, and foster a community of open source and open science enthusiasts. We hope that you will join us in this journey! 🚀💬👨‍💻


## Initial Focus 🎯

Our initial focus is on two main projects: PyLFG and the collection of open source grammars.

PyLFG (Python Library for Lexical Functional Grammar) is a comprehensive set of tools for working within the Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) formalism. LFG is a syntactic theory that represents the structure of natural language using a combination of lexical and functional information. PyLFG provides a set of classes and methods for representing and manipulating LFG structures, including f-structures and c-structures. The primary goal of PyLFG is to make LFG research more accessible to a wider community by providing a fully modular library that allows researchers to easily try new ideas and improve existing ones. With PyLFG, not only can you parse sentences, but you can also generate sentences from f-structures and perform automated translation. 💻📚

The collection of open source grammars will provide a valuable resource for teaching, research, and documenting under-resourced languages. 📖✏️ By working together as a community, we aim to build a comprehensive library of grammars that can be used by linguists, educators, and language advocates alike. 🌍🗣️

Together, PyLFG and the collection of open source grammars will advance the field of linguistics and promote the use of open source and open science in the field 🚀. Join us in this exciting journey! 🤝


## How to Contribute 🙌

At ARS Linguistica, we believe in the power of collaboration and community to drive progress and innovation. Whether you're a seasoned linguist, a software developer, or just someone with a passion for open source and open science, we welcome you to join us and contribute to our projects.

Here are just a few ways you can get involved:

1. Join the Community 💬
    - Participate in discussions and collaborations with other like-minded individuals to share ideas and make new connections.

2. Contribute to the Codebase 💻
    - Fix bugs, add new features, or improve existing ones. Your contributions will help make our tools more robust and effective.

3. Contribute Grammars 📚
    - Whether you're a native speaker of a language, or simply have an interest in linguistics, your contributions of grammars can help us document and preserve under-resourced languages, and advance our understanding of the world's linguistic diversity.

We're always looking for new and creative ways to improve our projects, so if you have any other ideas or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out! 🤗

## Future Goals :rocket:

At ARS Linguistica, we have big plans for the future and we're eager to make an impact in the field of linguistics. Here are some of our key goals for the future:

1. Expansion of the Toolset :toolbox:
    - We are dedicated to expanding our toolset to include more linguistics tools and resources. Our goal is to make ARS Linguistica a one-stop-shop for all things related to linguistics and open science.

2. Collaboration :two_women_holding_hands:
    - We believe that collaboration is key to advancing the field of linguistics. That's why we're eager to work with other organizations and individuals who share our mission and values. By joining forces, we can achieve more together than we could ever achieve alone.

3. Supporting Linguistic Research and Documentation :books:
    - Our aim is to support linguistic research and documentation by providing accessible and reliable tools and resources. We believe that everyone should have access to the resources they need to advance their linguistic knowledge, and we're working hard to make that a reality.

We hope you'll join us on this exciting journey to advance the field of linguistics through open source and open science! :sparkles:
